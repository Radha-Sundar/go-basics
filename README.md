# About GO

- Go was designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob PIke and Ken Thompson.
####
- Go was designed by Google in 2007.But it was released publicly in 2012.
####
- Go is an open source programming language,
  - Which means it is not proprietary and publicly accessible for free that can be modified or built in such a manner that is open to the public.
####
- Go is a multipurpose programming language.
  - It can be used for web development,data science, cloud computing,artificial intelligence and microcontroller programming,devops,commanding tools ,robotics and more.
####
- Go is simple and easy to understand language
  - It is well known for its simplicity,readability and efficiency
####
- Go is an cross-platform programming language
  - which means a programming language that can be developed and executed in more than one platform. Platform includes both hardware(amd64,386) architecture and operating system(Linux,windows,Android and iOS )
  - [Note: Go achieves this by supporting cross compilation
  To do cross compilation we need to specify GOOS and GOARCH during compilation before build]
####
- Go is statically typed and compiled programming language
  - Source code is compiled to native language. Go compiler will not just work on compiling code successfully but also ensures on type conversions and compatibility it catches entire classes of bugs..
####
- Go provides unit testing feature by itself
  - A simple mechanism to write your unit testing parallel to your code which enhances  your code coverage by your own tests.
####
- Go has a rich and powerful standard Library.
  - The robust standard library is distributed as packages.
  - There are packages to support io support,cryptography,testing
####
- Go gives High Performance
  - It is designed for automation on a large scale which makes it easy to write high performance applications.
####
- Go uses garbage Collection.
  - Go uses garbage collection which takes care of memory management automatically.which in turn helps to write concurrent programs easily.
####

- Popular tools which use Go are Kubernetes,Docker,Prometheus,go-ethereum
